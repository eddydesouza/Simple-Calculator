# Simple Calculator

This is a basic calculator application built using Python and Tkinter. The calculator provides essential arithmetic operations and dynamically resizes when the window is adjusted.

## Features

  . Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division

  . Clear Entry (CE) button to reset the display

  . Dynamic button resizing when the window is resized

  . Displays error messages for invalid calculations

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. No additional libraries are required.

## Usage
  1. Run the script:
   python or python3 eddy_calculator.py
  2. Click the buttons to enter numbers and operators.

  3. Press = to calculate the result.

  4. Press CE to reset the display.

## How It Works

  . The input is stored using tk.StringVar().

  . Buttons dynamically update the input field.

  . The eval() function processes the calculations safely.

  . Grid configuration ensures that buttons and the entry field resize dynamically.
